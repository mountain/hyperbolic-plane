# hyperbolic-plane-toolkit
toolkit for calculating and drawing points and lines on hyperbolic plane

## TODOs

### different models

* Poincaré disk model
* Poincaré half-plane model 
* Hyperboloid model
* Beltrami–Klein model

And conversions among them

### basic object

* Points and lines (they are dual in projective geometry)
* Circles, hypercycles and horocycles

### basic measurement

* Distance between two point
* Distance between two line
* Distance between point and line
* Angle among two line
* Inner product of two vector
* Area of a triangle
* ...

### basic operation

* Line between two point
* Point where two line cross at 
* Line which is parallel through a point with another line
* Line which is perpendicular at a point with another line
* ....

### visulization

* Poincaré disk
* Tessellation
